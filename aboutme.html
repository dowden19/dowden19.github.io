    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      &emsp;I am currently a Junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in
      Computer Science and Quantitative Biology. I am studying Computer Science because I enjoy tackling challenging problems and
      the feeling of satisfaction when my code finally works. Additionally, I like how programming can be applied to solve problems
      in every field. I am also studying Biology because I love learning about how our bodies work on a molecular level; I
      just finished probably my favorite class of all time which was Developmental Biology. I found it fascinating how we
      develop from single celled zygotes into fully functioning organisms. My goal is to find a career that combines my
      background in both, such as using machine learning to analyze biological data. However, in the meantime, I want to
      explore both fields, as I know they are highly dynamic and there is so much I have yet to learn.  <br><br>

      &emsp;For fun, I like playing Ultimate Frisbee on the club team at UNC, playing games with friends, reading novels,
      thrifting clothes and searching for little statues to put in my plants.<br><br>

      &emsp;I am looking for an internship for the summer of 2022, so feel free to reach out using the Contact page!
