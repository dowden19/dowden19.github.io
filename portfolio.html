      <h1>PlantTracker</h1>
      <p>&emsp; This summer I created a personal app for iOS using SwiftUI called PlantTracker. I made PlantTracker in order to both learn the SwiftUI framework and keep my plants alive, as I am still working on my coding skills and green thumb. <br> <br> &emsp;PlantTracker allows users to create a list of their plants, adding a name, picture, and frequency of watering for each one. The app then stores the data and sends notifications every few days, depending on the watering frequency set for each plant. While I have started using PlantTracker, I currently have no plans for releasing it in the appstore.</p>

      <h1>BigBen Bot</h1>
      <p>&emsp;I made a Discord Bot named BigBen this summer in order to apply Python in a real project. Making this app helped me understand Python better in general, while also being a good way to learn specific packages like APScheduler and Discord. <br> <br> &emsp;The BigBen bot joins the General voice channel every hour, on the hour, and makes a few bell chimes before leaving. It's like having the real Big Ben in your discord server!</p>

      <h1>Mentorship Research</h1>
      <p>&emsp;At the North Carolina School of Science and Math I participated in the Mentorship program where I worked in a research lab at UNC. As a research intern at the Castillo Labs I conducted an independent research project under a graduate student in Marine Biology. <br><br>
        &emsp;The project involved looking at the isotope composition of coral cores to track changing temperatures in the Bocas del Toro Reef Complex in Panama. You can click the link below to access a pdf version of the poster that is easier to view.
