      <h1>PlantTracker</h1>
      <p>&emsp; This summer I created a personal app for iOS using SwiftUI called PlantTracker. I made PlantTracker in order to both learn the SwiftUI framework and keep my plants alive, as I am still working on my coding skills and green thumb. <br> <br> &emsp;PlantTracker allows users to create a list of their plants, adding a name, picture, and frequency of watering for each one. The app then stores the data and sends notifications every few days, depending on the watering frequency set for each plant. While I have started using PlantTracker, I currently have no plans for releasing it in the appstore.</p>

      <h1>BigBen Bot</h1>
      <p>&emsp;I made a Discord Bot named BigBen this summer in order to use the python I was learning in a real project. Making this app helped me understand python better in general, while also being a good way to learn specific packages like APScheduler and Discord. <br> <br> &emsp;The BigBen bot joins the General voice channel every hour, on the hour, and makes a few bell chimes before leaving. It's like having the real Big Ben in your discord server!</p>
